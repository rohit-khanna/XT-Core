# ATM Money Dispenser

### Core Functionality (work flow)
User enters the amount(whole numbers only) needed in the text field. On clicking on “Get Money” – the app computes the least number of notes needed to get to the exact amount (which the ATM would dispense). The possible denominations are of Rs. 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 2000.  The computed count gets displayed on the right panel
